Soundboardy is a soundboard type of app.
It is meant to run on the desktop.
The purpose of the application is to have a way to easily play sounds while streaming.
Why play sounds? Because I want to make funny sounds any time I or someone else makes an outrageous remark on the stream.


How the UI should look:


|--------------------------------|
|															   |
|	 Button							Button		 |
|															   |
|															   |
|															   |
|	 Button							Button		 |
|															   |
|															   |
|															   |
|	 Button							Button		 |
|																 |
|--------------------------------|


How it works:

We have multiple buttons.
Each button can be configured to play a specific sound.


technical requirements:

- Save sound configuration. basically which sound file is going to be played and where.
- We need it to be cross platform (OSX, Windows, Linux)
- Easy to use and setup
- No internet connection
- Lightweight
- Play sounds from keyboard press (maybe)


Things we know:

- Volume is going to be controlled by system volume.


Questions:

What type of sound files are we going to play? MP3? WAV? OGG?
yes, those 3

Should it allow n amount of buttons or do we want to limit it?
No, I think it should be up to 8 buttons. 4 rows of 2.


Can we bind keys to the board while streaming?

I dont know yet. TBD
